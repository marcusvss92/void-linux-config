# ============= EXAMPLES FOR CUSTOMIZATION =============

# Uncomment and modify as needed:

# Allow specific user without password for everything (DANGEROUS)
# permit nopass username as root

# Allow specific commands for specific users
# permit nopass username as root cmd /path/to/specific/command

# Allow running as different user
# permit :wheel as postgres cmd /usr/bin/createdb

# Time-limited permissions
# permit :wheel as root cmd /usr/bin/some-command env { timeout=3600 }

# ============= NOTES =============

# - Lines starting with # are comments
# - Order matters: first matching rule wins
# - Use 'doas -C /etc/doas.conf' to check syntax
# - Test configuration before logging out
# - 'permit persist' caches authentication for 5 minutes
# - 'permit nopass' allows command without password
# - Always test dangerous configurations in a VM first

# ============= USEFUL COMMANDS =============

# Check doas configuration:
# doas -C /etc/doas.conf

# Test a command:
# doas whoami
